## Who am I?
- ðŸ‘‹ **Hi, Iâ€™m Sam!**
- I have a degree in **Technical Communication** (technical writing), and am interested in documentation, software, and weirdly enough; weather.
- Iâ€™m currently learning how to leverge my knowldge in technical communication to become a well-rounded and effective technical writer. I'm also learning the basics of coding and web development on the side and hope to be at a proficient level in the next couple years.
- On the personal side - My hobbies include skiing, storm chasing, photography, travel, and playing guitar. I'm a die hard Texas Tech sports fan (my alma mater), I play videogames from time to time whenever I get a chance, and am rehabbing my knee to hopefully get back into mountaineering training in the near future.

## About my GitHub
* At the moment, I am using GitHub to learn **[Docs as Code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/)**, **HTML/CSS**, and **web development** basics through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I will be using my profile to practice, share, and learn various concepts surrounding these topics!
* I will also be keeping updated notes in my **[Notes repository](https://github.com/saloset/Notes).** The readme in that repo will explain in detail, however, you can expect to find all sorts of notes in there from Technical Writing, to web dev, to practically anything I'm learning. Feel free to take a look and use whatever you want! 
* In the future, I plan to continue adding notes to this profile, but furthermore, I plan on adding projects, web pages, and my own documentation to this as I continue to learn.
* I will also be contributing to open source documentation as soon as I'm a bit more comfortable with the process so if you're here because I'm wanting to collaborate on a project of yours - **Hi!**

**Again, please feel free to reach out at [my website](https://samtrujillo.info) or through GitHub and I'll be more than happy to touch base! Thank you for reading!**
